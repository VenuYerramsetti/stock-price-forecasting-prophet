# Prophet Forecast Project

This repository contains code for generating time series forecasts using **Prophet**, a powerful forecasting tool developed by Meta (Facebook).

## üì∏ Output

Once you run the code, a forecast plot will be saved as `forecast_plot.png`. The plot will also be displayed interactively using `matplotlib`.

## üí° About Prophet

Prophet is designed for forecasting time series data and excels at handling various challenges, including:

* **Seasonality:** Automatically detects and models yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality.
* **Holidays:** Allows for the inclusion of custom holiday effects.
* **Trend Modeling:** Captures non-linear trends in your data.
* **Robustness:** Works effectively even with missing data and outliers.

## üåê How GitHub Fits In

This GitHub repository serves as a central hub for this project:

* **Hosts the source code:** All the project files are stored here.
* **Tracks project history:** You can see all the changes made to the code over time.
* **Shares the project with others:** Makes it easy for collaborators and others to access and contribute.

**Important Note:** GitHub does not execute your code directly. To run this project, you'll need to **clone the repository** and execute the code locally on your machine or within a cloud notebook environment.

## üöÄ Optional: Run in Google Colab or Binder

For a quick and easy way to run this notebook online without any local setup, you can use one of these free platforms:

[![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME/blob/main/YOUR_NOTEBOOK_NAME.ipynb)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME/main?filepath=YOUR_NOTEBOOK_NAME.ipynb)

**Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME`, `YOUR_REPO_NAME`, and `YOUR_NOTEBOOK_NAME.ipynb` with your actual GitHub username, repository name, and the name of your Jupyter Notebook file.**

Alternatively, you can upload the notebook directly to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and run all cells there.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/VenuYerramsetti/stock-price-forecasting-prophet
cd stock-price-forecasting-prophet

# 2. Set Up the Environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If needed, install manually:
pip install yfinance prophet matplotlib pandas

# If Prophet fails, try:
pip install pystan==2.19.1.1
pip install prophet

# 3. Run the Code
# To run the script:
python stock_forecast.py

# Or to run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
# Then open `stock_forecast.ipynb` and run all cells
